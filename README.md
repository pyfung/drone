Even though the pdf shows the whole coursework, in this repo we focus on Part B of it.

# Origin and Ideas

In case anyone didn't notice, this is of course inspired by that long column of armoured vehicles during the initial days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The question is a variation of "that EMP in the matrix movie" question in: Kleinberg and Tardos, Algorithm Design, Pearson 2008, Chapter 6 Question 8 (though apparently the students didn't notice). But it is not a simple renaming and paraphrasing, and the solution is more involved.

# Hey cheaters

I'm pleased this proved too difficult a question. I don't think any of those cheating websites gave a remotely correct answer.

For example no one gave an answer [here](https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/country-invaded-part-invasion-long-line-enemy-armoured-vehicles-moving-along-road-towards--q94545935) until many months afterwards. I haven't seen the answer (anyone kind enough to send me?) but I highly suspect it will be correct.

# Program code

The cpp files are one of the many (ultimately equivalent) ways of implementing the algorithm.
